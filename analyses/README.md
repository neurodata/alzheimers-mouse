## Statistical Inference

This folder contains two analyses:

- [Figures3_4.ipynb](./Figures3_4.ipynb): processes and analyses the estimated latent positions for the mice, studying the effects of genotypes, sex, age, and immunity (HN and non-HN). This produces figures 3 and 4 in the manuscript, and the associated pvalue table [analysis-hn.csv](https://github.com/neurodata/alzheimers-mouse/blob/main/results/pvalues/analysis-hn.csv).
- Figures5_6.ipynb](./Figures5_6.ipynb): processes and analyses the estimated latent positions for mice, exploring the effects of genotypes, sex, age, and diet (control and HFD). This produces figures 5 and 6 in the manuscript, and the associated pvalue table [analysis-diet.csv](https://github.com/neurodata/alzheimers-mouse/blob/main/results/pvalues/analysis-diet.csv).

These analyses were conducted separately for immunity and diet due to the fact that mice with certain combinations of risk factors (e.g., high-fat diet + non-HN immunity) were not collected.
